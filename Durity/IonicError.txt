        uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 19 cannot be smaller than version 22 declared in library [:CordovaLib] /ionic/platforms/android/CordovaLib/build/intermediates/library_manifest/debug/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 19
        Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 19,
                or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 22,
                or use tools:overrideLibrary="org.apache.cordova" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)
