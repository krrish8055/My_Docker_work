# To create the Image with all the required development packages and run the container with the volume use this command:
docker-compose up -d

# To terminate and clean all the Docker related resources including images, containers, volumes use this command:
docker-compose down --rm all

# To Tag the image and push to docker hub use this command.
docker tag (imageid) (repository-name):tag-name

Ex: docker push febatech/febatech:ionic

Note: as a prerequisite for pushing the image you should login to docker hub using docker-hub credentials using the command "docker login"

# after pushing if you want to pull the same image in to the another system you can use this command:
docker pull (image-name)
# or you can specify the image name in the docker-compose.yaml file and run "docker-compose up -d"

# for logging in to the container use this command:
docker exec -it (container-id or container name) /bin/bash
Ex: docker exec -it ionic /bin/bash

# for checking the running containers status.
docker ps

# for checking stopped containers status.
docker ps -a
